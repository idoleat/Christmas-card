# Christmas-card
Just playing around with text and some functions. Haha.
Windows only. It would be great if someone can write a OSX and Linux version.
The IDE I use is Code Block.

The two funtions I used to animate the text are system("cls") and gotoxy(). I've commented the URLs of which sites I took reference from.
Three things I found in this project:
1. system("cls") is more easily for me to code in this case, although it's not a efficient method.
2. I have tried to use gotoxy(), but it's a little bit complicate.
3. Still many parts can be improved, such as snow falling animation. But I have no time to add them....TAT
